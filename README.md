Vacation Planning Dashboard Overview

Business Problem
Our client aims to provide personalized vacation recommendations for users based on open data sources while encouraging environmentally responsible and sustainable travel choices. The goal is to offer users insights into travel destinations, accommodations, and activities to enhance their vacation experience, all with a priority of limiting their environmental impact.

Benefits
Personalized Vacation Planning: Users receive tailored vacation recommendations based on their preferences.
Optimized Budgeting: Budget-conscious travelers can plan their vacations that align with their financial constraints.
Real-time Updates: Users stay informed with real-time weather updates and event information.
Environmental Impact: Users can make informed decisions on their carbon footprint when determining their travel options.
This vacation planning project leverages travel-related datasets to provide users with personalized and data-driven vacation recommendations, making their trip planning experience more enjoyable and efficient.

Ideal Solution
Data Storage: Store the data in a database of your choice, explaining the reasoning behind your preference.
Feasibility Assessment: Determine what can be delivered within constraints such as time, money, people, and resources. Prioritize high-level requirements and identify "nice to have" features.
Collaboration: Work across the Bootcamp Workstreams to agree on priorities and develop a coherent solution.
Final Outcome: A simple dashboard (preferably PowerBI) that provides data-driven, personalized travel recommendations.
